# Damage-Net

As Damage-Net v1.0.0 is the first public release we are keen to receive any feedback!

This page is just a repo for the source code and to track updates.

All installers and futher information are available at www.damage-net.co.uk 

The Damage-Net website also provides extra information as well as provides a forum for discussion where users can raise issues, suggest new features and engage in general discussion.
